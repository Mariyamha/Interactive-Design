<h1>Myself</h1>
<p>I am Mariyam Hanan As-ad and I was born and raised in Maldives. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Creative Multimedia (specialising in graphic design) Taylorâ€™s Design School. A fun fact about me is that I love the local food here in Malaysia.</p>
<hr />

<h1>Experience in Interactive Design Class</h1>
<p>I have enjoyed the class a lot more than I thought I would. I like that the module not only focuses on design, but I also have the opportunity to use the little knowledge I have of copywriting and advertising as well. Apart from that, I am surprised that I was able to keep up in the coding class as I never thought I would ever find myself coding.</p>
<hr />

<h1>Expectations in this class</h1>
<p>By the end of this module, I hope to gain a better understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic coding</li>
<li>functional design</li>
<li>human behaviour</li></ul>
